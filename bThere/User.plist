➽ Terasz jeggyel jogosult vagy belépni a VIP bejáraton. A Teraszokról exkluzív helyről élvezheted a koncertet, és a koncertek utáni bulit.

A többi mint tíz éve ugyanazzal az öttagú felállással működő Foals a kétezres évek egyik legmeghatározóbb indie-zenekara, illetve legjobb példája annak, hogy a műfaj egyáltalán nincs leszállóágban, sőt. Tavaly megjelent negyedik stúdióalbumuk, a What Went Down egy egészen új szintre emelte a zenekart. Izgalmas visszatérésük tavaly kezdődött a lemez címadó dalával, de az igazi őrület a Mountain At My Gates című kislemezzel, és az ahhoz készült intertaktív GoPro-videóval vette kezdetét. 
Az augusztusi lemezmegjelenést egy meglepetés koncert előzte meg a Reading Fesztiválon, ami az NME szerint az egész esemény legjobb pillanata volt. Az albumot pedig remek fogadtatás jellemezte, a legfontosabb magazinok (Uncut, Mojo, NME, GQ) is elismerően nyilatkoztak róla, sőt, az idei NME Awardson el is hozhatták a Legjobb Album díját. 
A többször a világ legjobb koncertzenekarának választott Foals tehát karrierjének csúcsán látogat újból hazánkba, hogy két fesztiválos fellépése után végre önálló koncerten mutathassa meg, valóban érdemes a címre. 
Találkozunk augusztus 17-én a Budapest Parkban!

			<string>What is the Festival of Books?
The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books began in 1996 with a simple goal: to bring together the people who create books with the people who love to read them. The festival was an immediate success and has evolved to include live bands, poetry readings, chef demos, cultural entertainment and artists creating their work on-site. There’s also a photography exhibit, film screenings followed by Q&amp;A’s and discussion panels on some of today’s hottest topics.

Where is it?
On the USC campus.

Who attends the festival?
The festival attracts approximately 150,000 people each year of all ages from Southern California and even other parts of the country.</string>

			<string>Beyond Wonderland returns to Southern California Friday, March 18, and Saturday, March 19, 2016, at the San Manuel Amphitheater &amp; Grounds in San Bernardino, CA. There, Headliners will be swept away into a beautiful dreamscape of incredible music across four stages, interactive art installations, roaming performers and much, much more.

Headliners can once again sleep under the stars and join the enthusiastic community of the expanded Beyond Wonderland camping every night after the festival. The campground will feature decorated grassy fields and day and night entertainment, from morning yoga sessions to Silent Disco parties until sunrise. Tent, car and RV camping spots will be available, as well as turnkey camping options, including safari-style tents, fully furnished accommodations, memory foam beds and more. 

“These Wonderland events were born and raised in Southern California, and so much of their unique style is inspired by the Headliners who attend them,” said Pasquale Rotella, Founder and CEO of Insomniac. “The magical spirit of our Headliners continues to make Beyond Wonderland a special experience.”

Our FREE signature event culminates the Lunar New Year festivities with engaging community booths, museum tours, live entertainment, music, arts &amp; crafts, and food trucks.

A hugely popular Chinese festival around the world, Lantern Festival occurs annually on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month to mark the closing of Chinese New Year festivities.

Note: LA County Ordinance prohibits the use and release of sky lanterns with open flames. We are currently working with the venue to hang as many lanterns as possible for the Lantern Festival event.</string>

Grateful focuses on Joy, a college freshman at USC.  After tragedy strikes, Joy attempts to explain her emotional experience and mental processes to others and to herself but fails, jeopardizing her support system. Vietnamese culture traditionally emphasizes problem solving within family lines, but for a loss of this magnitude, the Vietnamese community unites to assist the Le Family in their time of need.
